```app:minDistRequestDisallowParent```: The minimum distance (in px or dp) to the closest drag edge that the SwipeRevealLayout will disallow the parent to intercept touch event. It basically means the minimum distance to swipe until a RecyclerView (or something similar) cannot be scrolled.

```setSwipeListener(SwipeListener swipeListener)```: set the listener for the layout. You can use the full interface ```SwipeListener``` or a simplified listener class ```SimpleSwipeListener```

```open(boolean animation)```, ```close(boolean animation)```: open/close the layout. If ```animation``` is set to false, the listener will not be called.

```isOpened()```, ```isClosed()```: check if the layout is fully opened or closed.

```setMinFlingVelocity(int velocity)```: set the minimum fling velocity (dp/sec) to cause the layout to open/close.

```setEnableEdge(int edge)```: Enable the edge where the layout can be dragged from.

```setLockDrag(boolean lock)```: If set to true, the user cannot drag/swipe the layout.

```viewBinderHelper.lockSwipe(String... id), viewBinderHelper.unlockSwipe(String... id)```: Lock/unlock layouts which are binded to the binderHelper.

```viewBinderHelper.setOpenOnlyOne(boolean openOnlyOne)```: If ```openOnlyOne``` is set to true, you can only open one row at a time.

```viewBinderHelper.openLayout(String id)```: Open a layout. ```id``` is the id of the data object which is bind to the layout.
